                  Each condition has a unique type and reflects the status of a specific aspect of the resource.

                  Standard condition types include:
                  - "Ready": the schema is successfully registered in the registry
                  - "Progressing": the schema is being registered or updated
                  - "Failed": the schema registration failed

                  The status of each condition is one of True, False, or Unknown.
