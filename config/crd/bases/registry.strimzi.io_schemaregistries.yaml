                  Each condition has a unique type and reflects the status of a specific aspect of the resource.

                  Standard condition types include:
                  - "Ready": the schema registry is reachable and operational
                  - "Progressing": the schema registry connection is being established
                  - "Failed": connection to the schema registry failed

                  The status of each condition is one of True, False, or Unknown.
